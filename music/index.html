        <p>
            Lately I have been listening a lot to shoegaze music and dream pop. I mean, they are like cousins when
            speaking of music genres. Anyway, I’m trying not to feel too miserable, because this music is usually sadder
            than what I ordinarily listen to, but I really like those vibes.
            I’ve been totally glued to one specific song called “Starting Over” by LSD and the Search for God. I’ve been
            listening to that single song on repeat without getting tired at all. The start of the song is what I really
            like if I try to imagine what LSD could sound like, it would be something like that.
            I’ve never tried LSD or any psychedelic, really, but if someday I did, I would probably like to listen to
            that song. It’s just great all around, and that particular sound at the beginning is so good. I feel like
            I’m on a trip, literally searching for the most hidden and greatest thing in the world or the universe but
            feeling free and happy.
