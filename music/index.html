            Lately I have been listening a lot to shoegaze music and dream pop. I
            mean, they are like cousins when speaking of music genres. Anyway, I’m
            trying not to feel too miserable, because this music is usually sadder
            than what I ordinarily listen to, but I really like those vibes.

            I’ve been totally glued to one specific song called “Starting Over” by
            LSD and the Search for God. I’ve been listening to that single song on
            repeat without getting tired at all. The start of the song is what I
            really like; if I try to imagine what LSD could sound like, it would be
            something like that.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve never tried LSD or any psychedelic, really, but if someday I did, I
            would probably like to listen to that song. It’s just great all around,
            and that particular sound at the beginning is so good. I feel like I’m
            on a trip, literally searching for the most hidden and greatest thing in
            the world or the universe but feeling free and happy.
